SmartTable
==========

javascript library to draw large or small html tables with advanced controls such as sorting, filtering, and paging as well as many more. This requires no third party library to use. Native support for very large data sets that would typically kill the browser to draw (like 30k rows with 10 or more cells that have html elements in them) by drawing only a page of rows but allowing sort and filter on the full set of data as if the rows were present. Additional features like making rows selectable and quick selection sets as well are available with a simple flag. You can also have more than 1 SmartTable table on the page at once. 

The current release is fully functional but I am adding some additional features like control panel (to hide and show additional columns and control sorting behavior and such) and export csv (exporting exactly what is in the table via sort and filter). These new features should be out very shortly. 

A later release will convert this to more object oriented and extensible. 

Tips:
/dist/js and dist/css folders contains everything you need to use the library immediately 

Examples can be accessed by going to /dist/index.html or looking at the files contained in examples directory

More detals to follow.
